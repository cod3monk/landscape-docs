Private Repositories
====================

Landscape can check private repositories hosted on GitHub.

Checking private repositories requires `a monthly subscription <https://landscape.io/plans>`_, but you can
try Landscape for free for 14 days by `signing up for a free trial <https://landscape.io/start/trial>`_.

Is it secure?
-------------

We take security and the safety of your code very seriously. Full details of the
measures taken are on the `security page <https://landscape.io/security>`_. You can also
`send an email <mailto:security@landscape.io>`_ if you have any additional questions.

Are there discounts for non-profits or academic projects?
---------------------------------------------------------

If you have a non-profit or academic project, I'm happy to discuss a discount -
`send me an email <carl@landscape.io>`_.


My trial ran out before I tried it!
-----------------------------------

The free trials are pretty relaxed. If you ran out of time to try or need an extension, just
`send me an email <carl@landscape.io>`_.

Viewing repositories of your company
------------------------------------

If your company has a Landscape subscription and you want to be able to see the results, you will
need to grant Landscape permissions to view your list of private repositories on GitHub, so that
it knows which ones you can view. You can do this from
`your preferences page <https://landscape.io/preferences/github>`_.
